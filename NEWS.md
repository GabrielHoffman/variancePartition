# variancePartition 0.99.3
       o fitVarPartModel() and fitExractVarPartModel() use S4 instead of S3 calls 

# variancePartition 0.99.2
 - rename sort.varParFrac to sortCols
 - support ExpressionSet
 - change options for plotStratifyBy()

# variancePartition 0.0.12
 - add plotStratifyBy()
 - update documentation

# variancePartition 0.0.11
 - fix sort to work on correct argument

# variancePartition 0.0.10
 - fitExtractVarPartModel() and fitVarPartModel() now take subset argument
 - throw warning when no Intercept is specified
 - if using lmer, warning if categorical variable is modeled as fixed effect
 - fixed calcVarPart bug with reporting too few variances for multicategory fixed effects
 - add colinearityScore

# variancePartition 0.0.9
    o function now use the precision weights when specified
 - remove warning about unspecified weights, when useWeights=TRUE
 - fix issue with sort with only one variable
 - add main argument to plotVarPart

# variancePartition 0.0.8
        o Bug update to vignette and simulated data

# variancePartition 0.0.7
 - remove 'variable' from xlab of plotVarPart

# variancePartition 0.0.6
 - set REML=FALSE to default.  This fixes issues of inaccurate variance estiamtes, and makes lmer() results more concordant with lm() results
 - Fix residuals function when lm or lmer is used
 - fix useWeights argument error for fitExtractVarPartModel()

# variancePartition 0.0.5
        o plotVarPart() as ylim=c(0,100) as default, and can be changed by user
 - fitExtractVarPartModel() labels rows correctly


# variancePartition 0.0.4
 - Add sort() for output of extractVarPart() or fitExtractVarPartModel()

# variancePartition 0.0.3
 - add residuals function
 - add fitExtractVarPartModel()
 - foreach loops us iterators

# variancePartition 0.99.0
 - Initial version
