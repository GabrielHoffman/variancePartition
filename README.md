### Notes
This is a developmental version. For stable release see [Bioconductor version](http://bioconductor.org/packages/variancePartition/).

For questions about specifying contrasts with dream, see [examples here](https://gist.github.com/GabrielHoffman/aa993222bae4d6b7d1caea2334aedbf7).


See [frequently asked questions](http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/variancePartition/inst/doc/FAQ.html).

See repo of [examples from the paper](https://github.com/GabrielHoffman/dream_analysis).

### Reporting bugs

Please help speed up bug fixes by providing a 'minimal reproducible example' that starts with a new R session.  I recommend the [reprex package](https://reprex.tidyverse.org) to produce a GitHub-ready example that is reproducable from a fresh R session.
